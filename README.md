This is a clock with all the three hands: seconds, minutes and hours!!
What I've learned from here:
- The date functions(like new Date(), getSeconds(), getMinutes(), getHours());
- Understanding the now const variable that plays the role of a struct(just like in C++);
- The ifs that must be with a straight forward argumet in order to make the arrow not to rotate back to 0, and continue on as a loop;
- The end statement that make the clock move every second; without it, the clock wouldn't work!
